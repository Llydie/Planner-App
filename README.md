# Planner-App
An app designed for planning and organisation purposes.\
**This is currently unfinished**\
This app currently functions as a basic to-do list creating app, allowing the user to add tasks to the list and then remove them when completed. This uses a database to store 
the tasks. It runs on Android phones as it was coded in Android Studio using Java as the base.

**ToDo in future updates**
- Add a calendar screen (allow monthly and weekly views?)
- Allow tasks to be moved from the to-do list to a slot on the calendar (user can input an estimated length of time to complete)
- Allow user to create multiple lists (when items from different lists are added to the calendar, they are a different colour?)
